# Rate Anime Themes

This is a web application called "Rate Anime Themes". The web application has a collection of anime themes (opening/ending songs) that users can listen to and rate accordingly. 

- FrontEnd: [stage-1-frontend](https://github.com/henoktilahun/anime_op_frontend/tree/stage-1-frontend-api)
  
Feel free to head to [Rate Anime Themes](http://rateanimethemes.com/) to check out the application.

### TODO:
- Preload audio source for faster playback
- Load limited anime themes at a time
- Use lazy loading for images?
